Phase 2 completion of an Android movie app that follows project guidelines found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZlN1fUsCSKuInLECcJkslIqvpKlP7jWL2TP9m6UiA6I/pub?embedded=true#h.cntdg23jy69n)

## Getting Started

If you want to see the application in action, clone the project and unzip it to your desired folder location. Open the project in Android Studio and build. 

Note: Android Studio may ask you to update certain dependencies. This is not reccomended as the project hasn't been tested using other configurations. Ignore these updates and run in an emulator with an Android APK level declared in the app folder's build.gradle file.
